h1. DTE Starter theme

h2. What is this?

This is a sample theme built upon "Duperrific Theme Engine":http://github.com/soska/dte/downloads (or DTE for short) a programming framework built with the idea to enable programmers to make advanced themes very easily.

This is not supposed to be a production theme, but as a starting point to use the DTE framework. If you hapen to build something swesome, let me know (I'm @soska on Twitter).
